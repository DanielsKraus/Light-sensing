# Light-sensing
Light sensing using photoresistors

## Instructions
- First download code
 
- Things required
  LED
  Photoresistor
  Wires
  220 ohm resistor for photoresistor
  100 ohm resistor for LED
  Aruino board or variant of it

- Hookup wires as follows
  5v pin for photoresistor
  GND on photoresistor and LED 
  place resistor inbetween GND for photoresistor and LED connection
  place 220 ohm resistor inbetween GND and A0 wire. 
  Then A0 wire hooks up to photoresistor
  place 100 ohm resistor inbetween GND and LED
  Digital pin 13 hooks up to posistive side of LED
